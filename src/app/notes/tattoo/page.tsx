        1) I recently rewatched Spirited Away. The last time I watched it was
        probably when I was really little, when I watched a lot of the Studio
        Ghibli movies with my family. I didn’t remember pretty much any of it,
        aside from the giant spirit-eating monster, No Face. That particular
        image had been etched by fear into the memory of my younger self.
        However, as the movie played, I felt a sense of familiarity in the
        unique imaginative imagery and story that only Hayao Miyazaki and Studio
        Ghibli can dream into existence: the lavish bath house of spirits, the
        evil witch and her enormous spoiled brat of a baby, and the little girl
        who has to navigate this ghastly world to save herself and her parents.
        The most important thing that Chihiro must do in order to save herself
        and her parents, is to remember her name. Yubaba, the evil witch, steals
        Chihiro's name when Chihiro, pleading for work in the bathouse that
        Yubaba runs, signs her contract. In this scene, Yubaba peels one of the
        characters of Chihiro's name off the page, assigning Chihiro the new
        name of Sen. Stealing names and the identities associated with them is
        how Yubaba lures people and spirits alike into an eternity of work in
        her bathhouse. Names are powerful. They are the gravity that keeps us
        from floating into space. They are also the containers for our
        experiences and our soul. They are the lighthouses that allow us to make
        our way back to shore after long expedition at sea and the bobbers we
        can watch attentively to know when a fish has taken our bait. Without
        such an anchor, we would quickly fade, as Chihiro begins to, or we would
        never know when to check our hook, to see if our bait is missing.

        2) On March 11th, 2023, I got a tattoo from one of my sister's friends,
        Rena, on my left forearm. It's the Chinese character for the word
        monkey. I had decided to get the tattoo the night before, when I was
        inebriated, but I had been planning to get this tattoo since before I
        had been admitted to college. The center of your left forearm is a very
        public place. When I wear a T-shirt, or roll my sleeves up, it's very
        visible. Some people ask me about it. When I'm meeting people for the
        first time, it inevitably comes into the conversation. Some people will
        compliment it. "NIce tattoo. That's dope." Some people will launch a
        full on inquiry. "So what does it mean? How is it significant to you?" I
        pride myself in being open about myself and my thoughts, but there are
        some things that I just can't talk about to others. Not out of
        embarrassment or fear that I will be judged, but because I get the
        feeling that there is a barrier of understanding between me and the
        other person or people. There are many ideas and thoughts that fall into
        this category. The significance of my tattoo is one of those things.
        Recently, I began to wonder if I regret getting my tattoo. After all,
        it's permanent. There is almost nothing in my day to day life that can
        be described as permanent. It's difficult to fathom what permanence
        means in the age where our attention spans (and our brains too )have
        been shrunken down to tiny amounts in comparison to what I feel like
        they once were.

        3) Infinite Jest <br /> Having a tattoo can say a lot about a person.
        Sometimes, it can yell a complete misunderstanding of what permanent
        means—or at least a dangerous disregard for the significance of it. As a
        rule of thumb, I would tell most people to refrain from getting a tattoo
        and absolutely refrain from getting any large, flashy tattoo in a
        visible place (like your neck, forearms, face, or lower legs). It's one
        of the easiest ways to feel a sense of resigned regret that only comes
        from making a dumb decision with permanent, irreversible consequences. I
        say this because impermanence is also permanent. People change. They
        constantly undergo experinces in their life that shape their identity
        and their perpsective on the world around them.

        4) Hou <br /> I was born in the year of the monkey, 2004. When I was
        little, my parents and grandparents endearingly referred to me as a
        little monkey. Always playful, cheerful, smiling, mischevious. It was
        completely unintentional—everything just made me smile and laugh when I
        was little. It's easy to laugh when your biggest responsiblity is to eat
        vegetables and brush your teeth everyday. In Chinese folk literature,
        one portrayal of monkeys is the legend of the monkey king, Sun Wukong.
        My grandma used to read the stories of Sun Wukong from little red books
        with colorful pictures and mandarin captions. Afterwards, I would sit at
        a tiny white table with scribbles in marker and crayon on it, and draw
        pictures from the books of Sun Wukong fighting villains with a
        shit-eating smirk and an infuriatingly nanchalant attitude. I used to
        have a jade monkey pendant that I lost. My sister also bought me a black
        shirt wiht a smiling monkey cartoon on it from China that I've since
        outgrown. I don't want to throw it out, even though I hate the clutter
        that it creates.

        5) 琴 <br /> I started piano the winter of my kindergarten year, when I
        was the wee little age of 5. As it tended to happen in my childhood, my
        parents signed me up following with my sister. My teacher, an old
        japanese lady, was a swet old lady. Like many of the other old ladies in
        my life, we got along quite well (based on overwhelming evidence, I'm
        convinced I have a charm on old ladies). I was told that my parents had
        exceedingly low expectations for me, due to several indications of
        retardation in my development in my pre-kindergarten years. However, to
        my family's surprise, piano was something I wasn't bad at. My fingers
        moved fast across keys, black and white. Folk tunes and scales, Mozart
        and Bach, Liszt and Chopin. I hated performing at recitals, and I hated
        competing at competitions even more. I try to forget as much as I can
        about playing piano. It just felt like one big waste of time. Maybe I
        cared too much. Or maybe I didn't care enough. Who knows. I don't have
        fond memories of it. Even so, my piano teacher fondly remembers me as
        Mr. Smiley.
