        I'm also a research asssitant at the Atlas Lab @ Brown University run by Prof. Nikos
        Vasilakis. As a member of the lab, I contribute towards projects aiming

        Outside of work, you&apos;ll find me unwinding by playing tennis and
        chess, reading novels and philsophy, and enjoying the great outdoors—I
        especially love to fish and hike!
